### Type made in Brazil — with attitude and intention.

## 👾 About 

Naipe Foundry is an independent Brazilian type foundry creating fonts with cultural weight and graphic grit. Rooted in Rio, our work explores the intersection of local heritage and global ideas — one letter at a time.

We move slowly, but we don’t stop.

## 🧰 What’s in this repo?

This repository is dedicated to sharing tools and fonts with the community:

- 🧠 **Scripts for Glyphs App**  
  Helpful extensions, automation, and time-savers for type designers.

- 🔤 **Open Source Fonts**  
  Experimental releases and collaborative projects available to use and remix.

We're here to share what we learn, build, and break.


## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome pull requests, feedback, and ideas.  
If you’ve got a script to share or a fork of a font, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

Let’s build things slowly and well.
